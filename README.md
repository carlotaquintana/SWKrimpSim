# SWKrimpSim: Structural similarity of RDF graphs using frequent pattern mining

## Content of the repository

Source code of the approach for a structural similarity of RDF graphs based on frequent patterns, and its related experiments. In this project, it is included the code for the proposal to evaluate the evolution of a dataset already accepted at SWJ (see citations).   

+ The [SWPattern folder](https://github.com/MaillPierre/SWKrimpSim/tree/master/SWPattern) contains the source code for the conversion of RDF datasets and updates to transaction, and their comparison and evaluation using codetables. 

+ The [Scripts folder](https://github.com/MaillPierre/SWKrimpSim/tree/master/scripts) contains the scripts used to retrieve code tables from Vreeken's implementations of KRIMP and SLIM.

+ The [Slim archive](https://github.com/MaillPierre/SWKrimpSim/blob/master/SlimBinSource-20120607mod.tar.gz) contains our modification of Vreeken's SLIM implementation to be able to handle very large number of items (by removing a hard coded limit).

+ The [PythonCode folder](https://github.com/MaillPierre/SWKrimpSim/tree/master/pythonCode) contains the code used for the data analysis relative to our experiments.

## Running the SLIM Docker image

A Docker image is provided to execute the complete workflow without installing Java, SLIM, or any additional dependencies. The container can start either from an already generated transaction database (`.dat`) or directly from an RDF dataset (`.nt`).

### Build the image

```bash
docker build -t swkrimpsim-slim .
```

This command only needs to be executed once (or again after modifying the Dockerfile or the execution script).

### Option 1: Run from a `.dat` database

```bash
docker run --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -v "$(pwd)":/work swkrimpsim-slim <database_name>
```

where `<database_name>` is the dataset name **with or without** the `.dat` extension.

Example:

```bash
docker run --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -v "$(pwd)":/work swkrimpsim-slim WktEN
```

The file `WktEN.dat` must be located in the current working directory.

### Option 2: Run from an RDF dataset (`.nt`)

```bash
docker run --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -v "$(pwd)":/work swkrimpsim-slim <dataset.nt> <nP|nPT> [index.idx]
```

Parameters:

- `dataset.nt` : RDF dataset in N-Triples format.
- `nP` : build transactions using properties only.
- `nPT` : build transactions using properties and types.
- `index.idx` *(optional)* : existing index to reuse and update, or the name of a new index to create. If no name is given, it will assign a default one.

Examples:

Create a new index automatically:

```bash
docker run --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -v "$(pwd)":/work swkrimpsim-slim dataset.nt nP
```

Reuse an existing index:

```bash
docker run --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -v "$(pwd)":/work swkrimpsim-slim dataset.nt nPT conversionIndex.idx
```

### Output

After the execution finishes, all generated files are stored in:

```text
results/<database_name>-output/
```

Depending on the execution mode, this directory may contain:

- the generated code table (`.ct`);
- execution reports (`.csv`);
- the converted SLIM database (`.db`);
- the database analysis (`.db.analysis.txt`);
- the transaction database (`.dat`);
- the conversion index (`.idx`), if one was generated or updated.

### Removing the Docker image

If the Docker image is no longer needed, it can be removed with:

```bash
docker rmi swkrimpsim-slim
```

### Notes

* The container is executed using the current user (`--user $(id -u):$(id -g)`), so the generated files can be modified or removed without administrator/root privileges.
* The `--rm` option automatically removes the container after the execution finishes.
* The current directory is mounted inside the container as `/work`, allowing the input datasets and output files to be shared with the host system.
